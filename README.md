## 📌 Overview of the Project

**Project:** CODE REFACTORING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION  
In this project, I took an existing simple To-Do list web application built in JavaScript and refactored it for better readability, structure, and performance. The main focus was to improve code modularity, enhance performance by optimizing DOM manipulations, and ensure scalability for future features.

This task demonstrates the ability to take an existing application and apply principles of clean code, modularization, and performance optimization to improve both maintainability and user experience.

## 💡 Features

- **Modular Code**: Separated core functionality into different files like `app.js`, `domHelpers.js`, and `style.css`.
- **Optimized DOM Manipulation**: Used efficient DOM updates to minimize reflows and repaints.
- **Improved Readability**: Clear structure, variable names, and modular functions.
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling to avoid unnecessary event listeners.
- **Error Handling**: Added basic validation and checks.
- **Performance**: Reduced redundant operations and optimized updates to improve responsiveness.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Utilities**: Modular JavaScript (helper functions)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub (for collaboration and version management)
