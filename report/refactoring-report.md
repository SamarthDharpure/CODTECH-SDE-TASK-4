## 🛠️ Refactoring Summary

| Original Issue                  | Refactored Solution                                      | Benefit                                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Monolithic script              | Separated into multiple files (e.g., `domHelpers.js`)    | Better maintainability and reuse               |
| Direct DOM manipulation inline | Abstracted using helper functions                        | Cleaner code and reduced duplication           |
| No comments/documentation      | Added inline documentation and JSDoc                     | Easier to understand and extend                |
| Unorganized UI logic           | Isolated UI logic in rendering function                  | Improved readability and logic separation      |

## ⚙️ Performance Optimization

- **DOM Updates**: Batched updates via `innerHTML` to reduce reflow and repaint cycles.
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Optimized rendering to only redraw when data changes.
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling via scoped event listeners.
